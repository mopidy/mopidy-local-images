Mopidy-Local-Images
========================================================================

Mopidy-Local-Images is a Mopidy_ local library and Web extension that
allows Web clients access to album art embedded in local media files.
It does so by acting as a *proxy* between Mopidy's ``local scan``
command and the actual local library provider being used.  Images are
extracted from media files and stored as individual image files while
scanning, and corresponding image URIs are inserted into Mopidy data
models.  Clients can then access these images through the Web
extension.  All other requests are delegated to the actual local
library provider as-is.

Album art stored in separate files is also supported.  External image
files will be considered if they reside in the same directory as the
scanned media files and file names match a configurable pattern.

Please note that support for local album art depends on whether your
client supports album images as provided by Mopidy's data model.  For
example, some clients will ignore any images provided by this
extension, and will retrieve album art from external services instead.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mopidy-Local-Images can be installed using pip_ by running::

    pip install Mopidy-Local-Images


Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before starting Mopidy, you must change your configuration to switch
to using Mopidy-Local-Images as your local library provider::

  [local]
  library = images

By default, Mopidy-Local-Images delegates any requests to the standard
``json`` local library provider.  To use a third-party library, such
as `Mopidy-Local-SQLite`_, you have to set this in the
``local-images`` configuration section::

  [local-images]
  library = sqlite

Once this has been set, you need to clear and re-scan your library for
images to be extracted::

  mopidy local clear
  mopidy local scan

This extension also provides some other configuration settings, but
beware that these are subject to change for now::

  [local-images]
  enabled = true

  # the actual local library provider to use
  library = json

  # the base URI for images; change this if you want to serve images
  # using an alternative Web server, or when accessing Mopidy through a
  # reverse proxy
  base_uri = /images/

  # the directory where local image files are stored; if not set,
  # creates its own subdirectory in <core/data_dir>
  image_dir =

  # a list of file names to check for when searching for external album
  # art; may contain UNIX shell patterns, i.e. "*", "?", etc.
  album_art_files = *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png

Known Bugs and Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Mopidy v0.19, using this extension will slow down ``mopidy local
scan`` considerably, since every media file has to be scanned twice.
This should no longer be a problem in Mopidy v1.0 and later versions.
